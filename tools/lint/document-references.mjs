/*
 * The files the documents point at have to be there.
 *
 * These documents name modules constantly -- which rule lives where, which
 * module owns the executables, where the bundler is -- and this repository
 * moves modules. A reference that no longer resolves sends a reader looking
 * for something that is not there, and nothing else would notice: the prose
 * still reads perfectly.
 *
 * Only backticked paths count, which is how these documents write a filename,
 * and a path is only a path here if it has a separator in it, at least one
 * letter -- `1/2` is a fraction, and prose is full of them -- and no ellipsis,
 * which means the prose is describing a shape rather than naming a file. A
 * `..` component is the same: these documents explain how a path is resolved,
 * and nothing in this repository is named by climbing out of a folder.
